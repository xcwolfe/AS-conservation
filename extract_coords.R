## intron_sums_heatmap is the uniqueness index of intron retention events in C. elegans. This heatmap was published (alongisde similar heatmaps for other alternative splicing types) in the manuscript "Deep transcriptomics reveals cell-specific isoforms of pan-neuronal genes" (Wolfe et al. 2025)

  # extract the AS event ID from the rownames of the heatmap:
  id <- unlist(strsplit(rowname, " "))[2]
  
  # split the AS event ID by underscore to extract coordinates:
  parts <- unlist(strsplit(id, "_"))
  chr <- as.character(parts[1])
  start <- as.numeric(parts[3])
  end <- as.numeric(parts[4])
  
  return(c(chr, start, end))
})
